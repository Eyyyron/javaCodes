 Grading Program Problem:
 The numeric computerProgramming1.prelim grade of a student for a subject is computed by the expression
 ((student's grade for the quizzes) + (student's grade for the examination)) / 2
 The grade for the quizzes is computed by the expression
 (student's total quiz scores) / (perfect total quiz score) * 50 + 50
 The grade for the examination is computed by the expression
 (student's examination score) / (perfect examination score) * 50 + 50
 A corresponding letter grade is given to the student based on the following rules.
 If NUMERIC GRADE is then LETTER GRADE is
 =================== =========================
 >= 50 but < 75 D
 >= 75 but < 80 C
 >= 80 but < 90 B
 >= 90 but <= 100 A

 Analysis:
 Input: Name of the Student, Perfect Total Quiz Score, Total Quiz Score, Perfect Examination Score, Examination Score

 Process:
 1. Assign the value to the name of the student
 2. Assign the value to the perfect total quiz score
 3. Assign the value to the total quiz score
 4. Assign the value to the perfect examination score
 5. Assign the value to the examination score
 6. Compute the grade for the quizzes
 7. Compute the grade for the exam
 8. Compute the numeric grade
 9. Compute the letter grade
 10. Display the results
 11. End the process

 Output: Grade for the Quizzes, Grade for the Exam, Numeric Grade, Letter Grade

 Algorithm:
 1. Declare and initialize the variable perfectTotalQuizScore that represents the
 perfect total quiz score.
 2. Declare and initialize the variable totalQuizScore that represents the total quiz
 score of a student.
 3. Declare and initialize the variable perfectExamScore that represents the perfect
 score for the examination.
 4. Declare and initialize the variable examScore that represents the examination
 score of a student.
 5. Declare and initialize the variable quizGrade that represents the grade of a
 student for his/her quiz scores.
 6. Declare and initialize the variable examGrade that represents the grade of a
 student for his/her examination score.
 7. Declare and initialize the variable numericGrade that represents the numeric
 computerProgramming1.prelim grade of a student.
 8. Declare and initialize the variable letterGrade that represents the letter computerProgramming1.prelim
 grade of a student.
 9. Declare and initialize the variable studentName that represents the name of a
 student.
 10. Display a message that explains that the running program is a utility for
 computing the computerProgramming1.prelim grade of a student.
 11. Read the name of a student
 12. Read the perfect total quiz score from the keyboard. The perfect total quiz score
 read must be validated such that it cannot be less than or equal to zero. If the user
 enters an invalid perfect total quiz score, an appropriate error message should be
 displayed on the screen and the program execution should end.
 13. Read the total quiz score of the student. The total quiz score read must be
 validated such that it should not be greater than the perfect total quiz score or the
 it must not be less than zero. If the user enters an invalid total quiz score, an
 appropriate error message should be displayed on the screen and the program execution
 should end.
 14.Read the perfect score for the examination from the keyboard. The perfect score
 read must be validated such that it cannot be less than or equal to zero. If the user
 enters an invalid perfect score, an appropriate error message should be displayed on
 the screen and the program execution should end.
 15. Read the examination score of the student. The score read must be validated such
 that the score should not be greater than the perfect score or the score must not be
 less than zero. If the user enters an invalid perfect score, an appropriate error
 message should be displayed on the screen and the program execution should end.
 16. Compute grade of the student for the quizzes through the formula:
 quizGrade = (totalQuizScore / perfectQuizScore) * 50 + 50
 17. Compute grade of the student for the examination through the formula:
 examGrade = (examScore / perfectExamScore) * 50 +50
 18. Compute numerical computerProgramming1.prelim grade of the student through the formula:
 numericGrade = (quizGrade + examGrade) / 2
 19. Determine the letter grade of the student as follows
 if (numericGrade >=50 && numericGrade <75), let letterGrade= 'D'.
 if (numericGrade >=75 && numericGrade <80), let letterGrade= 'C'.
 if (numericGrade >=80 && numericGrade <90), let letterGrade= 'B'.
 if (numericGrade >=90 && numericGrade <=100), let letterGrade= 'A'.
 20. Display a summary of the result of the computation
